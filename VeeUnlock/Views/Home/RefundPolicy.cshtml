            Refunds will be given if an unlock has not been delivered within 30 days and has not already been rejected for any reason. You cannot cancel prior to the 30-day window as our contract with our suppliers is 30 days and we incur costs as soon as the unlock is submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Veeunlock.com will not refund an order that has been submitted for unlocking and is being processed. We incur the cost of unlocking from the carrier immediately once we submit your unlock. The turnaround times for all codes are explicitly stated on each individual phone page. If you cannot wait for your code to process, DO NOT PURCHASE.

            Blacklisted / stolen / lost phones / incorrect network provided (also known as Blocked) - The term black listed covers phones that are not paid off, lost, stolen, insurance claimed etc. It is the customer's responsibility to check whether the device is blacklisted. Lost, stolen and abused handsets are barred/blocked once reported and cannot be used inside the country it was blocked in on any major networks. If we undertake an unlock and find the phone has been marked Blocked and is in fact logged as either lost, stolen, abused, bad ESN and/or contract issues, we cannot refund your payment. We cannot unlock blacklisted phones, so please check before ordering.

            It is up to the customer to ensure the correct input of the phone's information and customer information when purchasing.

If the IMEI, phone number or network provided is later found to be submitted incorrectly by the customer then a refund will not be provided and the unlock request will come back “Blocked”.

Only then will a refund be issued. This video must be provided within 5 days of receipt of the code. No refunds are given after this point regardless of video provided.

             If your device has an iCloud activation lock and you cannot activate it, you must remove the iCloud account by contacting the owner of the device. We will not provide a refund where we have completed a sim carrier unlock which you are unable to use due to an Activation Lock.
